# Flappy Bird Clone JS

An attempt to make a Flappy Bird clone with Phaser (unfinished).

Created using Phaser 3.55.2

## Note
- The (barely) playable version is in index.html
- You can only play it on a local development server (unless you host it online)

## How to Play
- Gain altitude or move upward using Up arrow key
- Avoid the pipes (duh)
